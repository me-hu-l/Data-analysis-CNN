# Data-analysis-CNN

This is the final project we did as a group in the Data Analysis Tools in Experimental Research course CH6860

### Problem statement: 

3D time-lapse data of the fluorescence [RNA in a single live cell or Protein G3BP1]
presented in the form of a heat map (red = high-intensity area) can be quantified in each image
[compressed in one dimension] so that quantification can be performed for different conditions and assess
the difference between them (using hypothesis testing). The RNA and protein condense with time
(increase in signal intensity) due to the action of a chemical and forms stress granules or SGs (red-
coloured irregularly shaped areas in the images) implicated in various diseases.

The CNN model predicts whether the stress granules are present in an image or not.
